# Encryption Notes - DVA Exam Quick Revision

## AES-256
- **Advanced Encryption Standard** with **256-bit symmetric key**.  
- Same key used for **encryption & decryption**.  
- Used in **S3 (SSE-S3/SSE-KMS), EBS, RDS**.  

**‚ö° Gotcha:** AES-256 = symmetric, **do not confuse with asymmetric keys**.

---

## Envelope Encryption
- **Two-layer encryption**:
  1. **Data Key (DEK):** encrypts the actual data (fast, per-object key)  
  2. **Key Encryption Key (KEK):** encrypts the DEK (strong, centrally managed, stored in **KMS**)  

**How it works:**  
- Data ‚Üí encrypted with DEK ‚Üí ciphertext  
- DEK ‚Üí encrypted with KEK ‚Üí stored safely  
- Decrypt: KEK ‚Üí DEK ‚Üí data  

**Benefits:**  
- Secure key management, scalable, allows DEK rotation  
- Used in **S3 SSE-KMS**, **EBS**, **RDS encryption**

**‚ö° Gotcha / Mnemonic:**  
- Envelope Encryption = **‚ÄúLock the key, then lock the data‚Äù**  
- KEK = stored in **KMS**, never leaves unencrypted  
- DEK = per-object, encrypted by KEK

**Quick Recall Table:**

| Term | Purpose | Stored / Managed | Exam Tip |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| AES-256 | Symmetric encryption of data | Key known to encrypt/decrypt | Fast, secure, symmetric |
| DEK | Encrypts actual data | Stored with ciphertext | Per-object key, fast |
| KEK | Encrypts DEK | KMS / secure service | Strong, central key |


# Cross-Account Access

**Cross-account access** = Allowing resources or users in **one AWS account** to access resources in **another AWS account** securely.  

- Achieved using **IAM roles with trust policies** (not by sharing long-term credentials).  
- Common use cases:  
  - Centralized logging account accessing logs from other accounts (CloudWatch, S3).  
  - CI/CD account deploying resources into multiple target accounts.  
  - Sharing S3 buckets, KMS keys, DynamoDB tables, etc. across accounts.  

**‚ö° Gotcha:** Always use **IAM roles + trust policies**, not IAM users/keys, for cross-account setups.


# AWS Key Management Service (KMS) ‚Äì Exam Notes

## What is KMS?
- Managed service for creating, controlling, and using **encryption keys**.
- Provides **Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)**, now called **KMS Keys**.
- Keys are stored in **FIPS 140-2 validated HSMs** (Hardware Security Modules).
- Integrates with most AWS services (S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, etc.).

---

## Types of Keys
- **AWS Managed Keys:** Auto-created, free, one per service per region.
- **Customer Managed Keys (CMK/KMS Key):** Created & managed by you, full control (rotation, policies).
- **Customer Provided Keys:** Bring your own key material.
- **Data Key (DEK):** Temporary symmetric key to encrypt data (used in envelope encryption).

---

## Key Concepts
- **Symmetric Keys:** Single key for encrypt/decrypt. Default, widely used in AWS.
- **Asymmetric Keys:** Public/private key pairs (e.g., for digital signatures, RSA).
- **Key Policies:** JSON documents that define **who can use/manage keys**.
- **Automatic Key Rotation:**  
  - AWS managed keys ‚Üí rotated every 3 years.  
  - Customer managed keys ‚Üí optional yearly rotation.  

---

## Envelope Encryption
1. Generate a **Data Key (DEK)**.  
2. Encrypt plaintext data with DEK.  
3. Encrypt DEK with **KMS Key (KEK)**.  
4. Store encrypted DEK alongside ciphertext.  

**‚ö° Gotcha:** *Data is never encrypted directly with the KMS key ‚Äî only with DEKs.*

Mnemonic: **Data with DEK ‚Üí DEK with KEK**.

---

## How Keys Are Used
- **Encrypt API call:**  
  - Send plaintext to KMS (small amounts only, up to 4KB).  
  - Not scalable for large data.  
- **GenerateDataKey API call:**  
  - KMS returns **plaintext DEK + encrypted DEK**.  
  - Use plaintext DEK locally to encrypt big data, then discard it.  
  - Store encrypted DEK with your data.  

---

## Integration Examples
- **S3 SSE-KMS:** Data encrypted with DEK, DEK encrypted by KMS CMK.
- **EBS Encryption:** Volume data encrypted via KMS.
- **Lambda Env Vars:** Encrypted at rest using KMS.

---

## Gotchas ‚ö°
- **Plaintext key exposure:** DEK plaintext must be discarded after use.
- **KEK (CMK) never leaves KMS in plaintext** ‚Äì all ops happen inside HSM.
- **SSE-C (Customer-Provided Key):** AWS does not store your key; if lost, data is unrecoverable.
- **KMS Encrypt API limit:** Only small data (‚â§4KB). Use DEK for large files.
- **Cross-Account:** Use IAM roles + key policy for access, never long-term keys.
- **Key Deletion:** Scheduling required (min 7 days). Immediate delete not allowed.
- **Rotation:** Auto for AWS-managed; opt-in for customer-managed.
- **Asymmetric keys:** Limited usage (signing/verification, not bulk data encryption).

---

## Exam Tips
- KMS = **regional service** (keys don‚Äôt move between regions).  
- For **compliance/strict security**, use **Customer Managed Keys**.  
- Envelope encryption = must-know scenario.  
- For **performance** ‚Üí always encrypt large data with **DEKs**, not directly with CMKs.  
- If a question says ‚Äústrict policy, manage your own keys‚Äù ‚Üí Answer = Customer Managed CMK.  

# üîë AWS STS (Security Token Service) ‚Äì DVA Exam Notes

---

## üìå What is STS?
- **AWS STS = Security Token Service**
- Issues **short-term, temporary security credentials**:
  - **Access Key ID**
  - **Secret Access Key**
  - **Session Token**
  - **Expiration** (15 min ‚Äì 12 hrs depending on API)
- Removes the need for **long-term IAM users/keys**.

---

## üìå When is STS used?

| Use Case | Example | API Call |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Cross-Account Access** | Assume role in another AWS account | `AssumeRole` |
| **Federated Access (SAML)** | Corporate directory via Active Directory, Okta | `AssumeRoleWithSAML` |
| **Federated Access (OIDC)** | Login via Google, Facebook, Amazon Cognito | `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` |
| **Temporary Elevated Access** | MFA-protected API calls | `GetSessionToken` |
| **Custom Federation** | Temporary creds for non-IAM users | `GetFederationToken` |

---

## üìå Key STS API Calls

- `AssumeRole` ‚Üí Assume IAM role (same or cross-account).  
- `AssumeRoleWithSAML` ‚Üí SAML-based federation.  
- `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` ‚Üí OIDC-based federation (Cognito, Google).  
- `GetSessionToken` ‚Üí Temporary creds, often with MFA.  
- `GetFederationToken` ‚Üí Temporary creds for federated users.  

---

## üìå Exam Gotchas

- **Always temporary**: STS credentials are short-lived.  
- **Cognito Identity Pools** ‚Üí Use STS to give AWS creds.  
- **Cross-account access** ‚Üí Usually involves STS + resource-based policy.  
- **Best practice**: Prefer STS + IAM roles over long-term access keys.  

---

## üß† Memory Trick
**STS = Short-Term Security** ‚Üí ‚ÄúI give you temporary keys, not permanent ones.‚Äù


# üîê S3 Encryption & SigV4 ‚Äì Exam Refresher

## 1. What SigV4 Does (and Doesn‚Äôt Do)
- **SigV4 (with salted HMAC)** = Signs API requests to prove identity + integrity.  
- **It does NOT decrypt objects.**  
- Decryption depends on the S3 encryption mode.

---

## 2. S3 Encryption Modes (Who supplies the key? Who decrypts?)

| Mode      | Who supplies key? | Where is key stored? | Who decrypts on GET? | Exam Tip |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| **SSE-S3** (S3 managed keys) | AWS (auto-managed) | In S3 (AWS-managed) | S3 automatically | ‚ÄúEasiest mode ‚Äì just works if you have S3 perms.‚Äù |
| **SSE-KMS** (KMS keys) | AWS KMS CMK (AWS or customer-managed) | In KMS | S3 (after calling KMS `Decrypt`) | Need `kms:Decrypt` + IAM perms. Watch cross-account gotchas. |
| **SSE-C** (Customer-provided) | You (must supply key in headers for PUT & GET) | Not stored by S3 | S3 (derives encryption key using supplied key - HMAC-style derivation process) | If you lose key ‚Üí data unrecoverable. Must send key every time. |
| **Client-side** | You (encrypt before upload) | You manage outside AWS | You (decrypt after download) | AWS only stores ciphertext. |

---

## 3. SSE-C Deep Dive
- Upload: `Object + key` ‚Üí S3 salts/derives an internal key ‚Üí encrypts ‚Üí discards your key.  
- Download: You send **same key** ‚Üí S3 re-derives internal key ‚Üí decrypts object.  
- Wrong/missing key = object cannot be decrypted.  
- **AWS never stores your raw key.**

---

## 4. Quick Mnemonics
- **SSE-C** ‚Üí *Customer supplies key every time*.  
- **SSE-KMS** ‚Üí *KMS decides if you can decrypt*.  
- **SSE-S3** ‚Üí *S3 takes care of everything*.  
- **Client-side** ‚Üí *Client does all the work*.  

---

## 5. Exam Gotchas
- SigV4 = *signing*, not *encryption*.  
- SSE-KMS requires BOTH:  
  - IAM policy allowing S3 access.  
  - KMS key policy allowing `kms:Decrypt`.  
- SSE-C: AWS **never stores your key** ‚Üí lose it = lose data.  
- SSE-S3: Simplest, default server-side encryption.  
- Client-side: AWS is blind to plaintext.
