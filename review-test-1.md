# **ALLOWING SOME AUTHORIZED CLIENTS TO INVALIDATE CACHE**

## Recommended
- **API Gateway + 0Ô∏è‚É£ = authorized front door** (respects cache rules)  
  - Use **Require Authorization** in cache settings.  
  - Clients send **Cache-Control: max-age=0** to bypass cache.

## Not Recommended
- **STS = backdoor access** (bypasses the API)  
  - Giving clients direct DynamoDB access does **not** invalidate API Gateway cache.  
  - Bypasses API-level control, logging, throttling, and security.
 

# **Lambda Invocation Types**

- **Synchronous (RequestResponse)** ‚è≥: Caller waits, gets result immediately.  
- **Asynchronous (Event)** üöÄ: Caller doesn‚Äôt wait, Lambda retries on failure. ---ASYNC IS ALSO CALLED AS **EVENT ** 
- **Destinations**: Handle success/failure of async invocations externally (SNS, SQS, Lambda).

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Think of the ‚ÄúLayers‚Äù

| Layer | Who talks to whom | HTTPS / Certificate Notes |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Viewer ‚Üí CloudFront** | Users accessing your website | Controlled via **Viewer Protocol Policy** (HTTPS Only / Redirect HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS). **No ALB cert needed**. |
| **CloudFront ‚Üí ALB (origin)** | CloudFront fetching content from EC2 / ALB | Use HTTPS here if needed. ALB must have a **trusted certificate** (ACM or 3rd-party). **No self-signed certs**. |
| **ALB ‚Üí EC2** | Load balancer sending request to EC2 | Optional HTTPS internally. Usually HTTP is enough for internal traffic. |

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Rules

1. **Want HTTPS for your users?** ‚Üí Focus on **CloudFront Viewer Protocol Policy**.  
2. **Want HTTPS between CloudFront and ALB?** ‚Üí ALB needs a **trusted certificate**.  
3. **Never use self-signed certs in production** (browsers won‚Äôt trust it).  
4. **ALB does not come with a default cert** ‚Äî you must attach one manually.  
5. **S3 / storing certs** ‚Üí irrelevant for ALB or CloudFront HTTPS directly.

**‚ÄúViewer HTTPS ‚Üí CloudFront policy; CloudFront‚ÜíALB HTTPS ‚Üí ACM or CA cert; no self-signed, no defaults.‚Äù**


# Amazon ElastiCache

**Definition:** Amazon ElastiCache is a **fully managed in-memory caching service** that improves application performance by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory data stores instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.

# ElastiCache: Memcached vs Redis

| Feature                  | Memcached ‚úÖ                     | Redis ‚ùå                          |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Threading / CPU usage     | Multithreaded, uses multiple cores | Mostly single-threaded           |
| Scaling                   | Easy to scale out/in             | Requires sharding/replication    |
| Use case                  | Simple key/value cache           | Advanced features, persistence   |
| Key gotcha                | Best for multithreaded large nodes | Not ideal for multithreaded nodes|

**Memory Hook:** Memcached = simple, multithreaded, scalable; Redis = rich features but single-threaded.


# CloudWatch Alarm Key Concepts

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Period
- **Definition:** Number of consecutive periods CloudWatch uses to evaluate a metric.  
- **Period:** Granularity of each metric data point (e.g., 1 min).  
- **Use Case:** Track HTTP 5xx errors every minute ‚Üí set period = 1 min, evaluation periods = 3.  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Datapoints to Alarm
- **Definition:** Number of data points in the evaluation periods that must **breach the threshold** to trigger the alarm.  
- **Use Case:** Avoid false alarms for intermittent HTTP errors ‚Üí set datapoints to alarm = 3/3 (all 3 consecutive minutes must exceed threshold).  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Example Scenario
- **Metric:** HTTP 5xx errors (custom metric)  
- **Period:** 1 minute  
- **Evaluation Periods:** 3  
- **Datapoints to Alarm:** 3  
- **Behavior:** Alarm triggers **only if errors exceed threshold for all 3 consecutive minutes** ‚Üí prevents false alarms during intermittent spikes.

**Memory Hook:**  
**‚ÄúEvaluation periods = how many periods checked; datapoints to alarm = how many must breach ‚Üí ensures only consistent issues trigger the alarm.‚Äù**
